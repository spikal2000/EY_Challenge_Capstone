# EY_Challenge_Capstone

This project aims to create a model capable of predicting rice yield in Vietnam, using satellite imagery and weather data. Through combining historical yield data, climate factors, and machine learning techniques, we aspire to find patterns that will allow us to forecast future yields accurately. This is a crucial step towards ensuring global food security amidst the pressing challenges of climate change.
